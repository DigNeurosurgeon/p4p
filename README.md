# Programming for Physicians - full course

I started the ["Programming for Physicians" crash course](http://programmingfordoctors.com) late 2014 as an answer to all of you contactin me on how to learn computer programming. I really enjoy those emails, and as they are increasing in frequency, I guess it's now time for a full project.

Join the journey!
